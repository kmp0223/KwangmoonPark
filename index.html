    <p>Hi. My name is Kwangmoon Park, and I am a third-year Statistics Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin. I am currently working on statistical genomics and high dimensional statistics in Professor <a href="http://www.sunduzkeles.org">Keles' research group</a>. </p> 
    <p>I am mainly interested in questions related to understanding how genes are regulated by distal regions in the genome, particularly by functional non-coding regions. <br>For that purpose, I develop statistical tools for analyzing High-dimensional genomic data including Hi-C and HiCHIP, and devise methods to link diverse types of genomic data with better statistical interpretation. 
        <br>In the theoretical facet, I enjoy exploring the probabilistic and statistical properties of the methods I develop. </p>
    <p>Before joining UW-Madison, I earned a Master's degree in Statistics at the Yonsei University in 2020 and Dr. Seung-Ho Kang was my academic advisor. I earned my B.A. in Economics and Statistics at Yonsei University in Korea.</p>
